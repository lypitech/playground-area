# FastApi

### Pros

1. ultra fast to set up
2. versatile

### cons

1. no ORM -> forced to use sqlalchemy
2. young project
3. scalabilitiy

# Conclusion

Despite its strengths in terms of speed and flexibility, FastAPI will not be chosen for this project. Its ecosystem is still relatively young, the lack of a native ORM, and uncertainties around scalability make it less suitable for our long-term needs.
