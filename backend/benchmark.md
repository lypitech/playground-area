# Backend Benchmark: FastAPI vs NestJS vs Go

## Comparison Table

| Criteria                 | FastAPI (Python)                                 | NestJS (Node.js/TS)                        | Go (Golang)                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**             | Python                                           | TypeScript / JavaScript                    | Go                                             |
| **Raw Performance**      | Average (Python interpreter, depends on uvicorn) | Good (Node.js + TypeScript, scalable)      | Excellent (compiled, close to C performance)   |
| **Ease of Development**  | Very high (clear syntax, little boilerplate)     | Medium to high (MVC structure, decorators) | Medium (simple syntax but lower level)         |
| **Ecosystem**            | Rich (AI, data science, web, SQLAlchemy ORM)     | Large (npm, frontend/backend, modern libs) | Decent (solid stdlib, but smaller ecosystem)   |
| **Learning Curve**       | Low for Python developers                        | Medium (TypeScript + Nest concepts)        | Medium (simple syntax but different paradigm)  |
| **Scalability**          | Limited by Python GIL, good for I/O APIs         | Good (microservices-oriented, websockets)  | Very good (native concurrency support)         |
| **Community**            | Large (especially data/AI oriented)              | Large (backed by the JS ecosystem)         | Large and active (DevOps/backend focus)        |
| **ORM / DB Integration** | SQLAlchemy, Tortoise, Prisma (less mature)       | TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose (very mature)    | GORM, sqlx (good but lower level)              |
| **Typical Use Case**     | Quick APIs, ML/AI integrations                   | Full web apps, Node-based microservices    | High-performance services, distributed systems |

## Conclusion

- **FastAPI**

  - Strength: very fast development, simplicity, great for APIs (especially in **AI/data science**).
  - Weakness: performance and scalability limited by Python (GIL).

- **NestJS**

  - Strength: clear structure, rich ecosystem (npm, TypeORM, Prisma), well-suited for **web apps** and microservices.
  - Weakness: steeper initial learning curve (TypeScript + architecture).

- **Go**
  - Strength: **excellent performance** and native concurrency, ideal for distributed systems and **high-load backends**.
  - Weakness: smaller “out-of-the-box” ecosystem, more code compared to FastAPI or NestJS.
