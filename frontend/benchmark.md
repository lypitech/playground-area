# Frontend Benchmark: Angular vs React/TypeScript vs Svelte

## Comparison Table

| Criteria             | Angular                                 | React/TypeScript                              | Svelte                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Language**    | TypeScript                              | TypeScript / JavaScript                       | JavaScript / TypeScript                     |
| **Architecture**     | Full framework (opinionated, MVC-like)  | UI library, highly flexible                   | Compiled framework, component-driven        |
| **Performance**      | Good, but heavy bundles                 | Good, depends on chosen ecosystem             | Excellent (compiled to optimized JS)        |
| **Learning Curve**   | High (complex concepts, RxJS, modules)  | Medium (JS/TS + JSX, some ecosystem learning) | Low to medium (syntax close to native HTML) |
| **Ecosystem**        | Large, official, structured             | Very large (npm, many third-party tools)      | Smaller, but rapidly growing                |
| **Community**        | Large and active (Google)               | Very large and dominant (Meta, OSS)           | Smaller but very active                     |
| **Scalability**      | Very good for large enterprise projects | Good, requires strong architecture discipline | Less suited for very large projects         |
| **Typical Use Case** | Enterprise apps, complex projects       | Versatile web apps, flexible frontends        | Lightweight apps, fast prototypes           |

## Conclusion

- **Angular**

  - Strength: complete and structured framework, well-suited for large enterprise-grade applications.
  - Weakness: steep learning curve and initial heaviness.

- **React/TypeScript**

  - Strength: flexibility, huge ecosystem, de facto standard in modern web development.
  - Weakness: requires assembling and choosing many tools (routing, state management, etc.).

- **Svelte**
  - Strength: excellent performance and simplicity, syntax close to native HTML.
  - Weakness: smaller ecosystem and less proven for very large-scale projects.
