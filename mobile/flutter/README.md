# Flutter

## Pros

- Fast development: Hot reload and large [widget library](https://pub.dev) makes development easier
  and faster.
- Great UI/UX consistency: Same look across Android and iOS.
- Cross-platform: One code for both Android and iOS (can even extend to website, macOS/Windows app).
- Rich ecosystem: Large set of [packages](https://pub.dev) and community support.
- Experience: I already have created a big mobile app using Flutter, making it safer since I won't
  struggle and do beginner mistakes.

## Cons

- Large app size: Flutter apps are bigger than native ones (43MB for a sample login page).
- Large SDK size: Flutter is a big SDK, and needs a heavy setup to begin working.
- Dart adoption: Smaller community compared to Java/Kotlin since Flutter has been released in 2017,
  though it's growing fast.
